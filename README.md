##Coffee (Sci. name Coffee arabica) is a major cash crop mostly grown under the shade of evergreen trees at altitude of 700-1500m in Nepal. It covers about 424 ha area, with production of about 150mt (dry cherry) and is distributed in Jhapa, Gulmi, Palpa, Syangja, Kaski, Tanahu, Chitwan, Kavrepalanchowk districts. Well drained, friable, rich in organic matter and slightly acidic soil is required for better berry development and ripening. In past few year, the production is severely affected by White stem Borer (Xylotrechus quadripes). It is long and slender having black forewings with white bands. Generally, female are larger in size than male adult. It makes the tunnel in the stem resulting in visible ridge, yellowing and wilting of leaves. Young plants of 7 to 8 years are mostly susceptible.
In hot and bright weather, borers are more active and after coming out from plant male and female borer mate and lays white oval eggs (100 at a time) in cracks of barks and under loose barks during Oct- Nov and April- June which later on turn pale yellowish. These eggs hatch in about 9 to 14 days and the larva start to feed near the bark for 2 months. The larvae stage from first instar to sixth instar takes about 6-8 months. The final instar larvae tunnels inside the stem and sometimes the tunnel may extend up to the root. This tunnel is filled with the excreta of larva. Pupation takes place in chamber close to barks which last for 20- 25 days. The adult borer remains in tunnel for a week and emerges out by making hole in stem. The adult male sustains for 2-3 weeks and adult female for 2- 4 weeks.

##Management:

a.	Proper Shading: Trees that are fast growing with deep root system and that are not the host for white borer such as Ficus sps, silver oak, siris, dadap, jack fruit should be planted before establishing coffee orchard that help to create wet condition which delay borer emergence.

b.	Pruning and uprooting: Plant having ridges should be trace year round. Regular pruning of old unproductive, diseased, damaged and weak branches should be done. Wilting yellow and infected plant should be uprooted prior to flight period during September and March and burned to avoid mating and laying egges.

c.	Scabbing: Scabbing of stem during September and March using Jute sack and coir groove reduce laying eggs by removing loose and crack barks. It can also be followed by pasting neem kernel extract or red soil and fresh cattle dung mixture.

d.	Use of Pheromone traps: Pheromone are the species specific chemical extremely effective in low doses but not toxic to insects used to confuse a mating insects. Cross vane pheromone traps, lure with chemical 2-hydroxy-3-decanone installed at 7 feet height during September and March helps to reduce the infestation of borer.

e.	Biological control: Apenesia spp and white muscardine fungus Beaveria, are highly effective for control of white stem borer.

f.	Use of Chemicals: 
I.	10% lime spray on main stem and loose barks during emergence of borer is highly effective.
II.	Spraying main stem and barks with lindane20 EC@1300ml in 200 of water along with 200 ml of any wetting agent during October and April.
